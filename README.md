## Explanation

This is a shell- script for linux, which was created to automate the process of connecting to an SSH- Server.

The script was initially created to connect to the ARM- SSH- Server of the TU Darmstadt, but can be modified and used with other SSH- Servers as well.

The script is designed to use a public and a private key, generated with putty, to authenticate yourself.
